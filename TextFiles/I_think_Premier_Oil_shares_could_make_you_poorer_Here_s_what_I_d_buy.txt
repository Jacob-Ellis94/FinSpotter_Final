On the 4th of July, I advised investors that it may be sensible to sell Premier Oil (LSE: PMO) shares after the stock doubled in value in a few weeks. Since then, shares in the oil producer have slumped by more than 50%. I think there could be further declines to come. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit!According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air…And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...The company’s indebtedness and low oil prices were the two main reasons I recommended selling the shares in July. These pressures have not gone away. It seems as if they’ve got worse. Oil prices have continued to languish, and Premier’s debt mountain remains a threat to the company’s survival. The group is trying to reduce its obligations by asking shareholders for more money.It’s seeking to raise $530m from shareholders as part of a $2.9bn refinancing. By comparison, the company’s current market capitalisation is £180m, or $234m. This suggests the cash call will significantly dilute investors. As such, I think now is a good time to sell Premier Oil shares ahead of further declines. If the company goes ahead with the equity raise, I reckon the shares could fall another 50% from current levels.Instead of Premier, I’d buy online property portal Rightmove (LSE: RMV).

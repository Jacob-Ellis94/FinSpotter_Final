(Bloomberg) -- Monday’s moves in emerging markets may look unexceptional. Drill down, however, and optimistic signs emerge.The benchmark gauge for emerging-market stocks is down 0.4% and its currency counterpart is little changed. That suggests investors are biding their time as they weigh the proliferating risks, from a technology-sector meltdown to U.S.-China tensions.But broader indexes that average out market moves can mask regional, sectoral and asset-class differentiation. That’s what seemed to be happening since the Thursday selloff in the Nasdaq 100 Index.

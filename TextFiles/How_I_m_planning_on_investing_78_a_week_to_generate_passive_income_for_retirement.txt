When you think of retirement, you likely associate it with a lack of work. Well at least a lack of working on things you don’t want to! One of these things is having to generate active income. So aiming to generate passive income from investing to top up your pension amount is a real project to start working on right now. The earlier the better, as the power of compounding means that even a small investment made years in advance can be of huge benefit when retirement comes around. One of my favourite ways to get passive income (both now and for the future) is via dividends. Dividends are paid by companies to their shareholders, usually once or twice a year. You’ll receive a set amount of income per share that you own, so you can work out in advance how much you’re due to receive. Although companies do change the amount they pay out depending on financial performance for that year, many firms have a commitment to paying out something every single year. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit!According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air…And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...

ZURICH (Reuters) - Kering-owned (PA:PRTP) Swiss watch brands Ulysse Nardin and Girard-Perregaux said on Monday they were cutting about 100 jobs, or a quarter of their total workforce, after sales were hit by the coronavirus crisis.The Swiss watch industry has seen demand collapse during the pandemic as stores around the world stayed closed for months and Chinese tourists no longer flocked to luxury shopping hubs like Paris."The sudden sales downturn caused by the pandemic, and thereafter, the watch sector's timid recovery, have led to the decision to scale down these manufacturing capabilities," the two brands said in a statement.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Demonstrators damaged seven of South African drug retailer  Clicks  Group's (J:CLSJ) shops on Monday and forced others to close during protests over what they said was a racist advertisement posted on its website.The advert by TRESemmé, a  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) brand, showed an image of African black hair which it described as "dry and damaged", while an example of white hair was referred to as "fine and flat".The advert, posted on Clicks' website on Friday, provoked a backlash on social media and the retailer removed it the same day. It apologized, as did TRESemmé South Africa.

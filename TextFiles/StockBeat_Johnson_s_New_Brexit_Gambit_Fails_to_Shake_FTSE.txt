By Geoffrey Smith Investing.com -- A Hard Brexit is coming, and neither stocks nor even the pound seems to care. According to a report in the Financial Times on Monday, the U.K. government is drafting new legislation that would essentially rip up the EU Withdrawal Agreement governing the current transition period, putting the U.K. back on course for a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to the south. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is also telling local media that a trade deal to govern relations between the U.K. and EU effectively has to be done by October 15, accelerating a deadline that is currently set for the end of the year.

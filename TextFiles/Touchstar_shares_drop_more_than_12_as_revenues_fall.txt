Mobile data computing solutions company Touchstar PLC (AIM:TST) saw its shares slide during Monday trading, with first half sales hampered by ‘crisis conditions’.Revenues for the first half of the year ended 30 June 2020 finished at £3.18 million, down from the previous first half sales figure of £3.64 million. Similarly, its revenue from continuing operations also fell, down from £3.37 million to £3.18 million.Despite these falls, Touchstar pulled off a remarkable turnaround, swinging from a £518,000 operating loss during H1 2019, to a £139,000 profit during H1 2020. Further, it swung from a trading loss before exceptional items of £215,000 and a loss after tax of £357,000, to a trading profit before exceptional items of £139,000 and a profit before tax of £150,000.Shareholders also enjoyed a turnaround in fortunes, with basic earnings per share swinging from a 4.21p loss to a 1.77p profit year-on-year.Also, the company’s overall balance sheet was far more upbeat at the end of the recent half-year period, with £1.46 million in cash versus a £204,000 overdraft at the end of the previous half-year.Responding to a challenging period of pandemic trading, and the turnaround in the Group’s financials, company Chairman, Ian Martin, commented:“Touchstar came into 2020 with momentum from a strong order book, clear strategic plans and a solid balance sheet. In the six months ended 30 June 2020 we have had to demonstrate resilience under crisis conditions. It is a real achievement that Touchstar traded profitably, generated cash, supported customers and most importantly looked after staff in a period of a global pandemic and the largest economic contraction in a generation – these are not normal times.”“We continue to outperform the road map we put in place in February to navigate the business through until 2022.”“Our motivation is not just to be a survivor of this crisis, the ambition is to emerge with solid finances, improved products, all our talent and renewed energy – we remain on track.”Despite some considerable and positive takeaways, the downturn in Touchstar revenues saw the company’s shares fall 12.38% or 6.50p, to 46.00p per share 07/09/20 12:00 GMT, following the publication of its results on Monday. This price is well ahead of its year-to-date nadir of 22.50p on March 24, but shy of its year-to-date high of 61.50p on August 19.The company’s market cap currently stands at £3.98 million.

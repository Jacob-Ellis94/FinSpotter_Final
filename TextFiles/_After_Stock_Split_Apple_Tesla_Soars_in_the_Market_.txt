The time has come. After weeks of sweaty-palm waiting, investors could now savor the fruit of their patience.Apple stocks jumped 1.4% on premarket stock trading. It closed at nearly $500 last Friday and now stands at $124.81 after the split-adjusted measures.Tesla jumped 1.0% as it trades for the first time since its split.The initiative by the two industry frontrunners aims to appeal to a greater number of investors, particularly to individual and small ones, by temporarily making their shares affordable.Considering the overall picture, the scheme does not make the company cheaper at all costs since the market cap remains in the same figure.According to a chief marketing strategist, it makes no sense that a share split should cause a rally on stocks, but most often, it does.This is due to the illusion that the firm is more within reach due to the retail price. Smaller investors can now afford to buy a stock from a previously skyrocketing price.Apple had given a four-for-one offering, its fifth time since it first happened in 1987. It will be Tesla’s first time making such a move since its initial public offering a decade ago.The generous five-for-one split came after the EV manufacturer’s stocks surged following strong performance amid the pandemic.After the stock split, nothing new will happen, experts say. Everything will remain in status quo, be it in the firms’ profitability or growth.The technology industry leaders will enjoy quite longer air time and popularity through making it to technology news headlines. However, overall, this will be meaningless when the upbeat mood subsides.As for Apple, stocks will go higher whether there is a stock split or not.Nevertheless, history suggests that the massive cap tech company gained 10% after four instances of stock split, which happened in 1987, 2000, 2005, and 2014.

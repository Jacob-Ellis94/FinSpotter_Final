Investor appetite for UK shares remains on the canvas today. Having been battered from pillar to post during the stock market crash of early 2020, a blend of severe macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns – from rebounding Covid-19 infection rates to Brexit and political uncertainty in the US – has kept the lid on market confidence. Dip buyers are in short supply.This is a great shame in my opinion. Sure, the global economy faces a period of serious strain in the near term and beyond. But there are still plenty of UK shares that could make long-term investors a fortune. Studies show that those who buy shares and hold them for 10 years or more make an average annual return of up to 10%. Investors who buy after stock market crashes have a chance to print even greater returns by buying high-quality UK shares at cheap prices, and then watching them balloon in value as the economic cycle recovers.5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit!According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air…And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...

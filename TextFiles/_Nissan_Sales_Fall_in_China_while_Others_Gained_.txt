It seems like Nissan encounters another hurdle of lousy luck as sales in one of its key markets drop while other Japanese carmakers experienced a rebound.In a statement released earlier in the week, the automobile manufacturer asserted that it plans to grow its Chinese market further this year.But current statistics suggest that this may not come as easy as it expected.Nissan Motor’s China sales dropped by 2.4% compared to the same period last year.This came at a time when its rival automakers recorded better than expected year-on-year yields.Nissan sold 126,592 units in China for August, translating to a 4.7% increase from July sales.Although this still lags below Toyota’s 164,400 units sold with 20,700 came from its premium frontrunner Lexus. The Aichi-based industry leader boasts a 27.2% jump from last year.Similarly, Honda sold 148,636 units driving it to record 19.7% gains.As if adding an insult to the injury, the slump adds to the firm’s struggle to revert the damage created by its former CEO Carlos Ghosn with his ambitious expansion drive. According to surveys, Nissan’s Qashqai model has a reputation for having the highest breakdown rate for cars under three years old. Some 21% of the unit’s owners complain about battery issues.Its Pulsar model reportedly suffers from the same battery headache. Similarly, the Juke also has problem with the fuel component system.Today, the Japanese carmaker is making an advance towards innovation for better product outputs in the future.It will employ techniques that will help speed up the production of the carbon fiber reinforced plastics also known as CFRP.CFRP is a lightweight but strong material used to make each car unit safe and fuel-efficient.The new mechanism can cut half of the lead time needed to develop components and another 80% save in the cycle time for molding, compared to the traditional method.A brighter future awaits next year’s new car roster as the company continuously invests in product improvement.

Royal Mail  (LSE:RMG) has been on a tear this week, with a whole 31% increase in share price as I write, compared to 2020’s average. As a result, it’s now at a one-year high, with much of the increase seen after it posted its trading update on 8 September. On that day alone, the Royal Mail share price increased by 25%. The update was more upbeat than expected, thanks to superior performance by the company’s parcel business even as its letters business struggled. As a result, it now expects that its 2020–21 revenue can be higher than it was last year. This is a marked shift in outlook from its June update, when it expected revenue to be up to £250bn lower compared to the year before. It also expects Covid-19-related costs to be lower than earlier anticipated. 5G is here – and shares of this ‘sleeping giant’ could be a great way for you to potentially profit!According to one leading industry firm, the 5G boom could create a global industry worth US$12.3 TRILLION out of thin air…And if you click here we’ll show you something that could be key to unlocking 5G’s full potential...So far, so good. But is that reason to buy the Royal Mail share at the current price? I’d consider the downsides carefully as well before taking a decision on it. The first point to consider is the ongoing economic uncertainty. Even though RMG’s business is closely linked to the economy, because the latest recession went hand-in-hand with the lockdown, the company’s business actually benefited. But with easing of lockdowns, RMG’s update says that there may be a slowing down in letters and parcels volumes. If we add economic weakness to the mix, then the next few months could be harder for it.

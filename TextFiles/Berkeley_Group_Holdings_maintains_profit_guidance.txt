Berkeley Group Holdings (LON:BKG) has reaffirmed their guidance of pre tax profit for the full year in  a trading statement released on Friday.The house builder said they saw pre tax profit at £500m with sales being weighted to the second half of the year due to coronavirus pandemic.Berkeley Group shares had gained 1.5% in morning trade on Friday following the news.The company also said it remained committed to returning £140 million to shareholders through dividends and share buy backs by 31st March 2021.“We now anticipate a more even split of profit between the first and second halves of the year, reflecting levels of production that have been better than initially anticipated and our decision not to furlough staff,” Berkeley Group Holdings.“Production continues to be impacted by the need for modified working practices and increased supervision, with the health, safety and well-being of our people remaining uppermost in our minds at all times. However, the experience and expertise of our construction teams and subcontractors, supported by our Health and Safety professionals, means that disruption has been minimised and efficiency levels are now at around 90% of normal.”

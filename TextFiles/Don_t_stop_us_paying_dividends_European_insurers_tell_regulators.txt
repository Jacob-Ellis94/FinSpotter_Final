LONDON (Reuters) - Global regulators should not ban insurers from paying dividends as a result of COVID-19 and should give firms more time to report their capital positions, European insurers said on Monday. The pandemic will likely lead to between $50 and $100 billion in losses for insurers, the Insurance Europe trade body said in response to a consultation by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) on the impact of the pandemic."A certain level of supervisory flexibility is ... crucial to enable insurers to adapt their products and services to new market realities," Insurance Europe said.

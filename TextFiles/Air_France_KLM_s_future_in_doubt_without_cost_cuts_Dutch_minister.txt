AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) might not survive its current crisis if the airline group cannot lower its costs, Dutch Finance minister Wopke Hoekstra said on Sunday."The survival of Air France-KLM is not a given," Hoekstra said in an interview on Dutch public television."They will have to address their cost base even as things stand now. And suppose this situation lasts until the end of next year, then they will have to cut even deeper."

PARIS (Reuters) - French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) will develop and assemble the next generation of partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY)'s Micra models, a senior executive at the Japanese firm said, as the two companies try to reboot their alliance with tighter cooperation in production. Ashwani Gupta, Nissan's chief operating officer, said in an interview with France's Le Monde newspaper published on Monday that the Micra plan was an example of their "leader-follower" strategy, with one firm taking the lead on certain car types. Nissan Micra models are already assembled at Renault's Flins factory in France, although that site is set to be turned over to recycling activities around 2024, when the life cycle of the car ranges made there expires.
